### Best practices for creating dashboards

* When creating a new dashboard, make sure it has a meaningful name.
* If you are creating a dashboard to play or experiment, then put the word TEST or TMP in the name.
* Consider including your name or initials in the dashboard name or as a tag so that people know who owns the dashboard.
* Remove temporary experiment dashboards when you are done with them.
* If you create many related dashboards, think about how to cross-reference them for easy navigation. 
* Grafana retrieves data from a data source. A basic understanding of data sources in general and your specific is important.
* Avoid unnecessary dashboard refreshing to reduce the load on the network or backend. For example, if your data changes every hour, then you donâ€™t need to set the dashboard refresh rate to 30 seconds.
* Use the left and right Y-axes when displaying time series with different units or ranges.
